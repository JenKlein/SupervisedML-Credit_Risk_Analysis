# SupervisedML-Credit_Risk_Analysis


## Overview
The purpose of this project was to build a supervised machine learning model to asses credit risk. Credit risk is an inherently unbalanced classification problem, as good loans easily outnumber risky loans. The imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries were used to build and evaluate the performance of models on whether they should be used to predict credit risk.
